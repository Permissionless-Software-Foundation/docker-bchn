# docker-bchn
A BCH full node based on the BCHN reference implementation.

This repository specifically targets the 'Cash Stack'
described at [FullStack.cash](https://fullstack.cash).

# Installation and Usage
- It's assumed that you are starting with a fresh installation of Ubuntu 18.04
LTS on a 64-bit machine. It's also assumed that you are installing as
a [non-root user with sudo privileges](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04).

- Install Docker on the host
system. [This tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04) shows
how to install Docker on a Ubuntu system. It's specifically targeted to Digital
Ocean's cloud servers, but should work for any Ubuntnu system.

- Install Docker Compose too. [This tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04)
shows how to do so on a Ubuntu system.

- Clone this repository in your home directory with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/christroutner/docker-bchn`

- Create a two directories in the same directory `docker-bchn`. These will be
used to store configuration data and blockchain data. Call them:
  - `config`
  - `blockchain-data`

- Copy the [run-script.sh](run-script.sh) and [bitcoin.conf](bitcoin.conf) file
into the `config` directory you just created. Customize the bitcoin.conf file for
your own full node.

- Enter the `docker-bchn` directory and start the container with this command:

`docker-compose up -d`

- Check on the status of bitcoind as it syncs to the blockchain:

`sudo tail ../blockchain-data


/debug.log`

- Or query the JSON RPC:

`curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc":"1.0","id":"curltext","method":"getnetworkinfo","params":[]}' -H 'content-type:text/plain;' http://bitcoin:password@127.0.0.1:8332/`

`curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc":"1.0","id":"curltext","method":"getblockchaininfo","params":[]}' -H 'content-type:text/plain;' http://bitcoin:password@127.0.0.1:8332/`

### Customization
- Customize the `volumes` setting in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
file in order to choose where you want the blockchain data and config files stored.

- Edit the bitcoin.conf file in the `config` directory and restart the container
if you need to change the configuration settings for the full node.

## Testnet
This repository has a `hd-testnet` branch that customizes the files in this
repository for testnet.
